                              <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
                        Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs,<br />
                        broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment <br />
                        has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser<br />
                        creators. The Garden of CSS invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters.<br />
                        Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion.<br />
                        Become one with the web.
                        <br /><br />
                        SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
                        There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Garden of CSS aims to excite,<br />
                        inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in <br />
                        the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML <br />
                        remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.<br />
                        CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only <br />
                        way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what <br />
                        it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty <br />
                        from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web;<br />
                        we can always push it further.
                        <br /><br />
                        PARTICIPATION
                        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, <br />
                        so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented <br />
                        well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see<br />
                        the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.<br />
                        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This <br />
                        may seem daunting at first if youâ€™ve never worked this way before, but follow<br />
                        the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
